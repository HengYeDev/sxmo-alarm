## To install and run:

Copy sxmo-alarm somewhere in either the root of your home directory 
or some other directory under your home on your Pinephone and

chmod +x sxmo-alarm

sudo ./sxmo-alarm from the directory that you installed it.

I've also supplied my .Xresources ( Gives the yellow / black theme ), picom.conf and modified conky.conf to work with the transparency.
